## Lab 3: Installing and Configuring Apache Web Servers

#### 1. Create the Ansible Playbook:

Create a file named `install-apache.yml` with the following content:

```
vi install-apache.yml
```
```yaml
---
- name: This play will install Apache web servers on all the hosts
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd using yum
      yum:
        name: httpd
        update_cache: yes
        state: latest
    
    - name: Upload custom index.html to all hosts
      copy:
        src: "index.html"
        dest: "/var/www/html/index.html"
    
    - name: Set attributes for index.html
      file:
        path: /var/www/html/index.html
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        mode: 0644
    
    - name: Start the httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
```

#### 2. Create the `index.html` File:

Create a file named `index.html` with the following content:

```
vi index.html
```   

```html
<html>
  <body>
  <h1>Welcome to CloudThat</h1>
  <img width="100%" src="https://10web.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/apache-logo-742x416.jpg">
  </body>
</html>
```

#### 3. Run the Ansible Playbook:
    
```sh
ansible-playbook install-apache.yml
```

#### 4. Verify Apache Installation:

Use `curl` to check if Apache is serving the `index.html` page:

```sh
curl http://<private-ip-of-vm-1>
```
```
curl http://<private-ip-of-vm-2>
```

Replace `<private-ip-of-vm-1>` and `<private-ip-of-vm-2>` with the actual private IP addresses of your VMs.
